# SCPKI_ACCUMULATOR
This project is just a shell for [accumulator_rs](https://github.com/hifided/accumulator-rs) based on substrate [pallet-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-pallet-template)  
So, it can be used like a pallet for [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework to build your own blockchain with rsa accumulators

P.S. won't work until [accumulator_rs](https://github.com/hifided/accumulator-rs) has no WASM32+no_std build (work in progres...)  
P.S.s. think i shouldn't post it on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) cause of P.S.
